# Functionalized FsNet

This repo is a modification and extension of the work presented in ["FsNet: Feature Selection Network on High-dimensional Biological Data"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08322).  See full citation below.

In this repo, I'm extending the author's original work to include regression tasks and functionalizing the model to better fit into model devlopment workflows containing hyperparameter tuning and experiment tracking.
